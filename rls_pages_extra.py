    "body": """  <h2><span class="n">01</span> The difference that matters</h2>
  <p>App-layer authorization lives in your code: an <code>if (row.userId !== me)</code> or a <code>.eq('user_id', me)</code> on every query. It works — until the one query that forgot the filter. That single miss is a cross-tenant breach, and it's invisible in code review because the code looks fine.</p>
  <p>RLS lives in the database. Once a policy is on the table, <b>every</b> query — from any client, any endpoint, any forgotten code path — is filtered. There's no query that can accidentally skip it. That's why RLS is a <em>boundary</em> and app-layer checks are <em>convenience</em>.</p>

  <h2><span class="n">02</span> Use RLS as the floor</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tenant isolation</b> — who can see whose rows. This is security; it belongs in RLS, always.</li>
    <li><b>Ownership and membership</b> — owner-scoped or workspace-scoped access. RLS.</li>
    <li><b>The service_role exception</b> — trusted server jobs bypass RLS on purpose; keep that key server-only.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="n">03</span> Where app-layer still belongs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>UX</b> — hiding a button the user isn't allowed to use, before they click it.</li>
    <li><b>Business rules</b> — "you can't archive a project with open invoices." Richer than a row filter; fine in code.</li>
    <li><b>Rate limits, workflow state, validation</b> — logic that isn't about row ownership.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The rule of thumb: if getting it wrong <b>leaks data</b>, it must be in RLS. If getting it wrong is a worse experience or a broken rule, app-layer is fine.</p>

  <h2><span class="n">04</span> Belt and suspenders</h2>
